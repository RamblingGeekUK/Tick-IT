# Tick-IT

Ten years ago for a primary school in the UK, I wrote a basic ticketing system for the staff to raise issues with any IT issues. 

This is the reimagining of that project using .net core 3.  The original was written in WebForms (I know). There is no reason for this other than to provide a project for me work on stream (Twitch).  

It would be fun if we could build it out for people to use it, if they wanted to. 

Test, test 2, test 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
